This plot shows the total number of runtime per season of the famous Netflix show, Black Mirror. As you can see, season 3 was a particularly thrilling one for fans of the show since it had almost *400 minutes* of runtime. I'm sure fans are excited to see more episodes of the show coming out soon. I found the data for this plot here at [awesome-json-datasets](https://github.com/jdorfman/awesome-json-datasets)!
